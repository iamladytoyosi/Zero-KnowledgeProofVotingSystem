# Zero-Knowledge Proof Voting System

A privacy-preserving voting system implemented as a smart contract that uses zero-knowledge proofs to maintain voter anonymity while ensuring voting integrity.

## Overview

This smart contract implements a secure voting system with the following key features:
- Voter registration and verification
- Anonymous vote submission using zero-knowledge proofs
- Vote verification mechanism
- Admin controls for voting period management
- Prevention of double voting
- Vote tallying

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

```clarity
;; Principal Storage
(define-data-var contract-owner principal tx-sender)
(define-data-var total-votes uint u0)
(define-data-var voting-open bool true)

;; Mappings
(define-map voters principal bool)        ;; Registered voters
(define-map votes principal uint)         ;; Voter participation record
(define-map vote-hashes (buff 32) bool)   ;; Anonymous vote hashes
```

### Error Codes

```clarity
(define-constant ERR-ALREADY-VOTED u1)
(define-constant ERR-NOT-REGISTERED u2)
(define-constant ERR-VOTING-CLOSED u3)
```

### Public Functions

1. **register-voter**
    - Registers a new voter in the system
    - Prevents duplicate registrations

2. **submit-vote**
    - Accepts a 32-byte vote hash
    - Verifies voter eligibility
    - Records vote while maintaining anonymity

3. **verify-vote**
    - Allows anyone to verify if a specific vote hash exists
    - Read-only function

4. **get-total-votes**
    - Returns the current total number of votes cast
    - Read-only function

5. **close-voting**
    - Restricted to contract owner
    - Permanently closes the voting period

6. **is-voting-open**
    - Check if voting period is still active
    - Read-only function

## Usage

### Voter Registration
```clarity
;; As a voter
(contract-call? .voting-system register-voter)
```

### Submitting a Vote
```clarity
;; As a registered voter
(contract-call? .voting-system submit-vote <vote-hash>)
```

### Verifying a Vote
```clarity
;; Anyone can verify
(contract-call? .voting-system verify-vote <vote-hash>)
```

### Administrative Actions
```clarity
;; Contract owner only
(contract-call? .voting-system close-voting)
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Privacy**
    - Votes are stored as hashes, maintaining voter anonymity
    - No direct link between voter identity and vote content

2. **Integrity**
    - One vote per registered voter
    - Immutable vote records
    - Vote verification mechanism

3. **Access Control**
    - Only registered voters can submit votes
    - Only contract owner can close voting
    - Public verification of votes

**Note**: This implementation requires careful consideration of the zero-knowledge proof generation and verification mechanism on the client side, which is not covered in this smart contract implementation.
